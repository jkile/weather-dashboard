# weather-dashboard

This is a weather dashboard that pulls both current weather and a 5-day forecast from a given location using the Open Weather api. Additionally, LocationIQ Reverse Geocoding has been added so that on load, the browser prompts for it's location and then is parsed into an initial search made to the users current location. From there, the user can use any of the predefined buttons for locations or search manually for a city.
